    <h1>This is an experiment</h1>
    <p>This pitch test will play a series of two short tones and ask you if the second tone is higher or lower than the first tone. This test measures your pitch perception abilities: As you advance in the test, it may sound as if the two tones are identical. This is never the case: they will always be a different pitch, even if that difference is imperceptible.</p>
